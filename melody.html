        <h2>Meditation and Spirituality</h2>
        <p>Meditation is a practise that allows lets to looking inwardly.It's a gentle journey into the self, where each moment spent in stillness reveals new layers of understandind and healing.<br>
        For me, Meditation has been a transformative experience, helping me connect with my inner self and accept myself for who i am without feeling shame.<br>
      Through meditation, I've learned to embrace my emotions and experiences fully.Each session brings a fresh perspective, allowing me to heal and grow.<br>It's  space where i can explore my thoughts without judgement, allowing me to love myself.<br>
    Spirituality,for me is the thread that weaves through my life, connecting me to everything around me.<br>It's all about recognizing the divine in the ordinary, finding love and grace in every encounter.<br>This journey has deepened my appreciation for life and i am forever grateful.<br>
  I cherish the sense of unity "tawhid" that comes from embracing the all.The interconnectedness of every being and the love that flows through it.<br>I've found a profound love for God and this encourages me to celebrate each moment, fostering gratitude for both the challenges and the joys.<br>I urge you to meditate, not only has this practise helped me heal but it has also opened by heart to the beauty of existence.</p>

        <h2>Poetry</h2>
        <p>I love poetry and i write a lot here's some of my works</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Weird maybe,anomaly eye, avant-garde , still weep like lain on a cold sunday night
            Fresh potatoes to make nimu , let loose and die trying
            I can see it and it looks bright like mr sun, “shine” i said to him, he gave me ideas and
            Led me to my mother, eccentric as ever I found a smile in my mothers garden
            To stand firm in my truth i went deep into the nile , the great nile speaks of the days of
            “Love” and “unity” i saw his great misery , in a split second i died and it made me demented, Must have been a dream Ugochukwu.!!
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p> Fool: Lies carried on my lips like the wind,
            They swirl around,
            I welcomed them at a tender age, A way 
            to cope with loss
            unaware of the weight i bore.
           Why did i ever lie?
           It became a soothing habit,
           comforting as melodies.
           My heart an open canvas, waiting for a painter's
           touch, He appears when i need him not,
           Yet i need him dearly.
           Stranger you've illuminated my deep-rooted struggle
           with Falsehood, I resent your arrival,
           knowing you'll soon depart, 
           But your presence has been vital for my healing journey.- Melody</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p> Who: What is this world?
Who am i?
what is my purpose?
Questions linger
Yet it's okay.
There's so much to see,
And so much unseen.

I yearn to visit the ocean 
to meditate, find my peace.
My inner calm comes first,
yet love knocks softly,
while i'm still in the shadows.

why was i chosen to be here?
Awakened suddenly,The world seems different.
What have I done?
I love this yet feel distant.

perhaps I still need to heal from wounds I cannot name.
My sanity, my insanity, A delicate dance on this vague path.

But I believe.
Everything will be okay
with each wave that crashes, I'll find my way. - Melody</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Love : THIS LOVE HATH ME TREMBLING;
            I HEARD A VOICE WHILST PRACTISING MINDFULNESS, BIDDING ME TO ACCEPT AND CHERISH THIS AFFECTION.
            YET FEAR HATH CAST A TONE-DEAF VEIL UPON ME, LIKE A RIVER, I YEARN TO FLOW, BUT IT SEEMETH NOT EASY. TO FIND ONE'S FOOTING IN A CONFINED SPACE IS AKIN TO SCATTERED PAPERS UPON A FOUNTAIN
           .O LOVE ME, STRANGER-SHOULDST THOU? OR AM I MERELY MENDING FROM MY PAST WOUNDS? -Melody
